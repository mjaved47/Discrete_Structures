# **Proposition Logic**
A proposition is a declarative sentence or statement that has a truth table.
In other words, it is a statement that is either **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
Each proposition has a truth value i.e. either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. It cannot be both True as well as False.

Propositions cannot be questions, general statements, demands, or hypotheses. Propositions do not contain any variables, quantifiers, or parameters.
- Do you have a pen?
- Let's go.
- x + 2 = 3
These are not propositions.
